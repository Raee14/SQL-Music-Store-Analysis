# SQL PROJECT- MUSIC STORE DATA ANALYSIS
Utilize SQL, specifically PostgreSQL via pgAdmin4, to delve into the music store dataset. By crafting different SQL queries and employing logical thinking, we provided insightful answers to key business questions, aiding the store in understanding its growth journey through effective data modeling. 

Following are the key business questions. 

#### Question Set 1
1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
2. Which countries have the most Invoices?
3. What are top 3 values of total invoice?
4. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music 
Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that 
has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice 
totals
5. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be 
declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the 
most money
####  Question Set 2 
1. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music 
listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A
2. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a 
query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands
3. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. 
Return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first
#### Question Set 3 â€“ Advance
1. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return
customer name, artist name and total spent
2. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the 
most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query 
that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum 
number of purchases is shared return all Genres
3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each 
country. Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how
